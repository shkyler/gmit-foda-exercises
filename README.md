### Assignment for Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module

This repository contains all of the files pertaining to my assignment submission for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module of the GMIT H.DIP in Data Analysis program. The main body of work is in the `anscombes.ipynb` Jupyter notebook file. This README.md file is a guide to set up and run the notebook.

* a `data` folder containing the anscombes quartet data set in a .csv file

### Dependancies

The dependencies for this are:
