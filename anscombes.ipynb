    "The objective of the assignement is to carry out some research into the \"Anscombes Quartet\" data set[2]. The data set is to be analysed in this notebook. There are four main tasks in the assignment[3]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain the background to the dataset – who created it, when it was created, and any speculation you can find regarding how it might have been created.\n",
    "1. Plot the interesting aspects of the dataset.\n",
    "1. Calculate the descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset.\n",
    "1. Explain why the dataset is interesting, referring to the plots and statistics above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before analysing the data set it must first be downloaded. It is widely available on the internet, for this assignment it was downloaded from [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/datasets/anscombe.csv). "
